## Features

- **Puppeteer Automation**: Automate tasks in a headful browser environment.
- **AI-Powered Element Detection**: Uses GPT-4 to convert natural language instructions into CSS selectors.
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retries, timeout handling, and detailed error reporting.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides real-time feedback through WebSocket.
- **Control Panel**: Pause, resume, or stop automation.
- **Result Display**: Shows extracted data, screenshots, and logs.
- **Responsive UI**: Built using React with Material-UI components.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 14.x
- NPM or Yarn
- Puppeteer requires a recent version of Chrome (handled by Puppeteer itself).

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/browser-automation-framework.git
cd browser-automation-framework
2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend/ folder and install the necessary dependencies:

cd backend
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend folder and add your OpenAI API key:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
Run the backend server:

node server.js
The backend will start on http://localhost:3001.

3. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend/ folder and install the dependencies:

cd frontend
